## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Feel free to fork this repository and use parts of the code for your own website. However, I encourage you to use this as a learning tool and ask that you modify the theme and widgets to make it your own, and have fun with React!

I've spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and redesigning this iteration of my website. If you decide to make use of this project, I'd appreciate being credited as the developer (by linking back to <a href="https://mrigankdoshy.com" target="_blank">mrigankdoshy.com</a>).

And obviously, I do not give permission to present any of my information or projects as your own.
